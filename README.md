Hi everyone! 🚀 This was my project on an Amusement Park Management System built using Spring Boot with proper database configuration.
We implemented 4 core entities and applied OOP concepts like abstraction to keep the design clean and modular.

🔹 User Features:
Book tickets 🎟️
Update ticket dates 📅
View all available park activities 🎡
🔹 Admin Features:
View, add, and delete activities 🏗️
Manage customer records 👥
This project really helped me strengthen my understanding of Spring Boot, database integration, and OOP principles in a real-world scenario.
